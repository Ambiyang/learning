### A brief anasis
##############################  
Ponhy obj will be executed even if its components' timestamps are not changed
```
.PONHY:all clean
``` 

condition  
```
ifeq ($(DEBUG),"true")  
CC = gcc -g  
else  
CC = gcc  
endif
```

### A makefile may have many objs but only the first one is regarded as the target obj
If `make` is executed `all1` will be run unless you designate `make all2`
```
all1:test1  
all2:test2
```
A obj can do nothing 
```
test1:  
	@echo "Just for test1"  
test2:  
	@echo "Just for test2"  
```
Its equivalent is
```
test1 test2:  
	@echo "Just for $@"  
#$@:Target Variable
```

```
hello:lcd.o player.o  
	@echo "start build hello"  
	$(CC) -o hello lcd.o player.o  
	@echo "build hello sucess"  
```
Take a look at this block
```	
player.o:player.c  
	$(CC) -o player.o -c player.c  
lcd.o:lcd.c  
	$(CC) -o lcd.o -c lcd.c  
```
Its equivalent is
```	
%.o:%.c  
	$(CC) -o $@ -c $^  
#$@:Target Variable  
#$^:Dependency Variable
```
### gcc implicit rule  
The above two rules can also be omitted since gcc regard the same name .c file as .o's dependency  

A clean rule with -f means it will remove the .o files even if they are not exit
```
clean:  
	rm -f lcd.o hello player.o
```
